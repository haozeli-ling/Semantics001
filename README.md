# Introductory Semantics
Course Site

This course is an introduction to the scientific study of language meaning. More concretely, we will investigate the meanings of sentences and various expressions in natural languages such as English, Mandarin, French, and so on. The main issues that this course aims to address include: 

- What sort of things could meanings be? 
- How do we use and understand language in actual communicative situations?
- What is the difference between literal meaning, implied meaning, and metaphorical meaning? 

Topics include truth conditions, reference and sense, theta-roles, tense, quantification, anaphora, pragmatic reasoning, and metaphor.  We will apply the toolkit of logic and math, including basic set theory and propositional and predicate logic, to linguistic examples in different languages. We will explore the methodology behind semantic and pragmatic research, such as constructing examples for acceptability judgements.

## Learning Goals

Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to:

- Define the core ways that meaning is characterized in linguistics and the theories about how the mind constructs meaning;
- List and illustrate the types of word-meaning relations, the characterisation of nominal and verbal semantics, and understand how context influences meaning at various levels (collocations, syntactic constructions, utterance and discourse context, etc.);
- Apply some of the basic formal tools to analyze language meaning;
- Describe how elements of semantics and pragmatics vary across languages; 
- Obtain hands-on practice in eliciting linguistic evidence to support a semantic and pragmatic analysis of a given lexical expression.
